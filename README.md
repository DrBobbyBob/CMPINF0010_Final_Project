# Metrics
- Median age of death
- Neighborhood employement
- School Enrollment

# Why
Median death age will help show if a neighborhood has violent issue and it can help show if a neighborhoods healthcare is good. Usually better healthcare equals higher median death age.
Neighborhood employment can help see if a neighborhood is wealthy or generally well off. The dataset that I have chosen has the amount of employemnt in certain fields like science and arts.
School enrollment will help us see if the neighborhood has a good school system set up to keep kids in school. It can help us see social economical warning signs if there are a lot of people who aren't in school. Additionally, the dataset has info on people from those neighborhoods who are attending college.

# Overarching theme
With me doing the median age of death and neighborhood employment and my team member doing school enrollment rates, we cover three important age groups -- the elderly, the adults, and the children -- as well as three different sectors of a neighborhood -- the education, economic, and health sectors. For us to find the best Pittsburgh neighborhood, we will want the neighborhood with the lowest median age of death, the highest amount of employed adults in usually well off jobs, and a high public school or private school enrollment.

# Concerns
With my datasets, they are roughly 8 years old but they are the only avalible dataset on that specific topic. While it might be old, it can still provide valuable insight into whether a neighborhood is the best or not. Of course, due to the age of the datasets, we will need to take the result with a grain of salt as it will not be totally representative of the current state of the neighborhoods today. -Y

My dataset was created in 2017, using data from 2015 which, like the other two datasets, was the only one on this topic available. It, along with the other datasets, will be used to determine the best neighborhood. It will be important to compare the raw numbers from the school enrollment dataset to the populations of these neighborhoods during this time, so as to derive rates from the dataset. The necessity of this step can be explained with an example: if 10,000 people were all enrolled in higher education in one neighborhood, this would appear very good. However, if there were 20,000,000 in the neighborhood in total, only a small percentage of the population would be enrolled, which is a significantly worse number. -M
