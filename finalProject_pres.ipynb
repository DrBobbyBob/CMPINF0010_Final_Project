    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "From the datasets provided by the WPRDC, we have selected three main metrics to identify the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the metrics:\n",
    "* Median Age of Death\n",
    "* Neighborhood Employment\n",
    "* School Enrollment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why\n",
    "Median death age will help show if a neighborhood has violent issue and it can help show if a neighborhoods healthcare is good. Usually better healthcare equals higher median death age. Neighborhood employment can help see if a neighborhood is wealthy or generally well off. The dataset that I have chosen has the amount of employemnt in certain fields like science and arts. School enrollment will help us see if the neighborhood has a good school system set up to keep kids in school. It can help us see social economical warning signs if there are a lot of people who aren't in school. Additionally, the dataset has info on people from those neighborhoods who are attending college.\n",

    "Here are the links to the datasets that we will be using:\n",

    "## Metric Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Median Age of Death\n",
    "The best neighborhood is a neighborhood with the highest median age of death. This statstic is usually an indicator of the healthcare system, violent crime rates, quality of life in the neighborhood, and general access to important resources. These traits are highly sought after in prospective homeowners. Therefore the higher the median age of death mean as better neighborhood to live in.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get which neighborhood had the highest median age of death, I trimmed my dataset down to two main columns. One was the repective Pittsburgh neighborhood, and the other was the median age of death of the total population. This allowed me to find the best neighborhood, according to this statistic, for any slect home buyer\n",
    "\n",
    "Winner: Squirrel Hill South\n",
    "\n",
    "Loser: Fairywood\n",
    "\n",
    "This is mainly due to the large population of older residence and the ease of access to important resources and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neighborhood Employment\n",
    "Employment reflects economic strength, job access, and general workforce participation. Neighborhoods with more employed residents often have stronger local economies, more stability, and better access to opportunity. My goal in this notebook is to quantify employment and identify which neighborhood performs best according to this specific metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a cear and interpretable metric, I extracted the columns of the neighborhood name, the total employed residents, employed males, and employed females. This allowed me to get the neighborhood with the highest total number of employed civilians age 16 and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Winner: Shadyside\n",
    "\n",
    "Loser: Allegheny Center\n",
    "\n",
    "### School Enrollment\n",
    "Like employment, school enrollment rates can act as a metric for how developed, economically stable, and quality of life. School enrollment rates are unique in this aspect, as they catalogue numbers typically filled by children and younger adults. This difference in perspective is crucial in determining the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to some of the data being unecessary and confusing, I trimmed down the data set for easier comprehen"
